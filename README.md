*Project Objectives*

By the end of this project:
You’ll be able to understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.
You will be able to know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.
Applying different algorithms according to the dataset
You will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.
You will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.

*Project Flow*

Find below the project flow to be followed while developing the project.

Download the dataset.
Preprocess or clean the data.
Analyze the pre-processed data.
Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
Save the model and its dependencies.
Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.

*Pre-Requisites*

In order to develop this project we need to install the following software/packages:

Step 1:

Anaconda Navigator :

Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,  package management system. Anaconda comes with great tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code.

For this project, we will be using Jupyter notebook and Spyder

To install Anaconda navigator and to know how to use Jupyter Notebook & Spyder using Anaconda watch the video

Step 2:

To build Machine learning models you must require the following packages

Sklearn: Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.

NumPy: NumPy is a Python package that stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object  

Pandas: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,built on top of the Python programming language. 

Matplotlib: It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits

Flask: Web framework used for building Web applications.

Watch the video below to learn how to install packages.

If you are using anaconda navigator, follow below steps to download required packages:

Open anaconda prompt.
Type “pip install numpy” and click enter.
Type “pip install pandas” and click enter.
Type “pip install matplotlib” and click enter.
Type “pip install scikit-learn” and click enter.
Type “pip install Flask” and click enter.

If you are using Pycharm IDE, you can install the packages through the command prompt and follow the same syntax as above.
